App is supposed to multiply 2 matrices by splitting them into the smallest possible parts meanwhile sending them over to all computers connected to the system.
There are 2 possible types of Distributed Systems:
MultiComputerSystem:
- there is MultiComputer(Master) connected with lower level MultiComputers which are connected with... etc. etc., the tree goes on
- Master receives Matrices, splits them and sends to lower level parts that are supposed to divide Matrices into even smaller pieces and equate them
- time spent to send packets is a possible issue
MultiProcessorSystem:
- there is MultiComputer(Master) connected with lower level Computers
- system has common memory
- queue is a possible issue
